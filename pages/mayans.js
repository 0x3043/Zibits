The Maya civilization was one of the most dominant Indigenous societies of Mesoamerica Era. Most of what historians know about the Maya comes from what remains of their architecture and art, including stone carvings and inscriptions on their buildings and monuments.

The Maya were great architects, mathematicians, astronomers, and artists. In their time, they built cities as grand and beautiful as any in Europe or the Far East. They were one of only a few people who invented the zero, a concept extremely important in mathematics. According to some calculations, their measurement of the length of the year was more accurate than that of the Europeans when they arrived in the New World. Their artists created a style that is considered one of the great art forms of history, and is today studied by artists throughout the world.

The Maya are Native Americans who have occupied parts of what is now southern Mexico
and Central America for thousands of years. During the Classic period, roughly the first
millennium of the Christian era, one of the world's most advanced civilisations flourished in this
area, and it was the Maya who were the bearers of this great tradition. The Classic Maya had
advanced mathematics, extensive knowledge of astronomy, the world's most accurate calendar, and a
writing system which they used to record the major events of their history.

After about AD 1000, Maya civilisation went into a decline, and The high culture maintained
by the royal courts disappeared over much of the area. By the time Europeans arrived in the
sixteenth century AD, Maya high culture survived only in northern Yucatan, where the first
missionaries were able to record basic information on the calendar, the writing system, and other
aspects of Maya culture and society. But the Europeans then crushed resistance to foreign rule,
burned the books of knowledge, and destroyed what remained of native high culture. The Maya
rulers were replaced or merged with the Colonial Spanish government, and the rest of the Maya were
reduced to the status of subjugated peasantry.</p>

                     <p className="text-xl text-white my-6  Poppitandfinch"> Today, there are several million speakers of Mayan languages living in the Maya area. Until recent times, these Mayans were
subsistence farmers practising a simple life style far removed from the glory of their ancestors'
courts. But many aspects of there culture have survived  centuries, and the Mayans in various
regions still use the ancient calendar, calculate by the same mathematics, and tell stories with
mythological and historical content using the rhetorical devices of Classic literature.

                     <p className="text-xl text-white my-6  Poppitandfinch"> A combination of archaeology, epigraphy  and prehistory, and the knowledge and lore of the modem Maya has made it possible for us
to reconstruct much of Classic culture. One of the most exciting recent developments has been the
near total decipher of the Classic Maya writing system, so that we can now read the Maya's
own records of the affairs of their rulers over a span of close to a thousand years.
Building on 150 years of slow, careful scholarship and suddenly booming, much of this
decipher has taken place in the last thirty years. <br></br><br></br>

Classic Maya writing makes use of a range of types of signs, some more related to
phonological units, the others more related to conceptual units. These may be called phonetic and
logo-syllabic signs, respectively. The same word may be written in the same text in a variety of
ways, making use of the possibilities offered by these two types of signs as well as by graphic
variants and stylistic variations in the visual representation of the individual signs. The Classic</p>
